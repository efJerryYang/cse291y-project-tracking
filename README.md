# CSE291Y Project - Secure Threading in Wasmtime

**Topics**: Primarily on the shared-memory issues of what the Wasmtime developers already aware of. Afterwards if we still have time, we will look at verification on the threading implementation.

**Team**: [@efJerryYang](https://github.com/efJerryYang), [@Blek1](https://github.com/Blek1)

**Upstream**: [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)

**Milestones**: Check out the **[Projects](https://github.com/efJerryYang/cse291y-project-tracking/projects?query=is%3Aopen)** tab for more details:

1. ramp-ups: both of us will first work on some simple existing/wip issues in this repository to get an understanding of this project, some related to cranelift codegen, some related to wasmtime runtime. we will have a better understanding of the problems to solve after this stage.
2. the shared memory issues (what the problems are, what we can solve in this quarter, any open questions we may don't have time to deal with at the moment)
3. the verification of threading implementation (why it is an open question for testing threading, what we can do to help with verification and testing)

**NOTE**: Please don't directly reference the upstream issue/PR URLs, it will cause numerious cross-reference in the upstream repository and cannot be removed unless we delete those issues/PRs from this repository. Some issues with those URLs have been recreated to avoid cross-references in upstream.
